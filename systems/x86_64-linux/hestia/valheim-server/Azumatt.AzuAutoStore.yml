# Below you can find example groups. Groups are used to exclude or includeOverride quickly. They are reusable lists! 
# Please note that some of these groups/container limitations are kinda pointless but are here for example.
# Make sure to follow the format of the example below. If you have any questions, please ask in my discord.

# There are several predefined groups set up for you that are not listed. You can use these just like you would any group you create yourself.
# These are the "All", "Food", "Potion", "Fish", "Swords", "Bows", "Crossbows", "Axes", "Clubs", "Knives", "Pickaxes", "Polearms", "Spears", "Equipment", "Boss Trophy", "Trophy", "Crops", "Seeds", "Ores", "Metals", and "Woods" groups.

# By default, if you don't specify a container below, it will be considered as you want to allow storing all objects into it.
# If you are having issues with a container, please make sure you have the full prefab name of the container. Additionally, make sure you have range and exclude or includeOverride set up correctly.
# Worst case you can define a container like this. This will allow everything to be pulled from the container within a range of 30.

## Please note that the below containers are just examples. You can add as many containers as you want.
## If you want to add a new container, just copy and paste the below example and change the name of the container to the prefab name of the container you want to add.
## The values are set up to include everything by using the includeOverride (aside from things that aren't really a part of vanilla recipes, like Swords or Bows). 
## This is to give you examples on how it's done, but still allow everything to be stored into the container.
